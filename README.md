# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program helps find reoccurring words in a list, then it outputs the findings into a seperate file.
What did you do particularly well?
The code is small and efficient, it also utilizes many comments to help somone follow along.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could better visuals to help enhance the experience. The code uses a little encapsulation, but more would help in the security aspect.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am pretty new to reading and writing to files, so that portion of code took longer than I expected. When I got stuck I would use w3schools for answers. 
It has visuals that help understand how a new function works. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I would say the brainstorming aspect at the beginning of my project would be transferable to other projects. Being profecient at wrinting out a solid action plan and adjusting 
it as you go is a big help with any team.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used many comments to help other programmers, and used industry standards while making the program for easy follow along.
